        <p>A girl recordes what she cooked. Mostly Asian food that I miss a lot.
        I cook main dish and that comes with rice and miso soup most of the time.
        And of course, eat with chopsticks.
        I might post food which is not really 'cooking' but for my recordes, I will post everything.

        Living in Europe, far from my mother land. Struggling with heavy, oily, fatty food.
        I used to eat a lot of vegs and fish cuz that are what I like the most.
        It's pricy to buy Asia food and ingredients but try to eat healthy diet.
